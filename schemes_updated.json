DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. \n\nNRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.\n\nThe Mission\n\"To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.\"\n\nThe Core Values\nInclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes\nTransparency and accountability of all processes and institutions\nOwnership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages \u2013 planning, implementation, and, monitoring\nCommunity self-reliance and self-dependence\n\nNRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - \n(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, \n(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, \n(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and \n(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. \n\nAs NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.",

        "details": "Details\nA training and skilling upgradation scheme by the Department of Industries & Commerce and implemented by the Directorate of Handicraft & Handloom, Government of Jammu & Kashmir wherein passout meritorious trainees and ex-trainees from departmental training centers are identified and are provided skill upgradation training in crafts which are facing human resource crunch as well as in languishing crafts. Registered Karkhanas/Karkhandars are identified who are willing to enroll a batch of trainees and ex-trainees in their Karkhana. A minimum of five trainees for a small Karkhana and a maximum of 10 trainees for a big Karkhana. A minimum of one and a maximum of five training programs per craft shall be considered for the six-month duration of the training program.\n\nObjectives of the Scheme:\n1.  Revive the languishing crafts.\n2.  Upscale the learning techniques of trainees. \n3.  Improve the wage earnings of the craftsmen by leading them into collectivization\n4.  Create linkages with producer organizations to inculcate entrepreneurship skills and aptitude in the trainees.\n\nVision of the scheme:\nThe artisans who form the backbone of the craft sector work in an exploitative chain of business leading them to a vicious cycle of poverty and pessimism. A huge number of artisans (mostly the male folk) are forced to abandon the craft activity due to low wage earnings and poor socio-economic status. It is felt that this scheme shall emerge as one of the most effective pathways to address the challenges being faced by the artisan community. Exposing the pass-out trainees to improved productivity procedures adopted by producer groups can lead them to better productivity and leverage their collective skill up-gradation which can help in promoting sustainable livelihoods as the artisans can gain direct access to customized production, new design development, technology-related modifications, and above all can have the pulse of market demands.",

For classes 1st to 10th the dropout rate of girls was about 64% in the same year. Hence, only 36% of the country's girl students could be retained up to class 10th.

It has the purpose of accessing most financial services for citizens and making it simple for them. These include basic deposit and savings accounts, credit, remittance, pension, insurance, and others available with an inexpensive pay range. The Indian Prime Minister came up with the idea of the Jan Dhan Yojana to ensure that the citizens can envisage their financial activities securely across the country.\n\nPMJDY aims at covering every household with a basic Bank Account and a RuPay Debit Card. It can have an inbuilt insurance cover worth \u20b9100,000. Moreover, it also includes an overdraft facility of up to \u20b95,000. Furthermore, the mission of PM Jan Dhan Yojana also includes Direct Benefit Transfer under the Indian Government schemes. The long-term goal of the scheme is to extend the Financial Literacy Program to the grassroots levels of villages.\n\nJan Dhan Yojana is, therefore, an essential and ambitious scheme from the Indian Government. The ultimate objective is to enable the citizens to understand financial operations and conduct them without difficulties. Keeping this in mind, some of the smaller objectives of the PMJDY scheme include the following:\n1.  Dividing each district into Sub Service Areas (SSA) to ensure banking services are available to them\n2.  Providing each household with Basic Banking Accounts and RuPay Debit cards\n3.  Spreading financial literacy to the village levels\n4.  Creating Credit Guarantee Fund for covering defaults in overdraft accounts\n5.  Providing microinsurance to the eligible citizens\n6.  Designing pension schemes like Swavlamban for the unorganized sector",

        "details": "Details\nPAHAL (DBTL) has been introduced to curb the diversion of subsidized LPG. Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.\n\nBefore PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market. \n\nTo infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.\n\nPAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using \"Form 5\" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC\u2019s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.\n\nThe DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database. \n\nSuch a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC\u2019s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district. \n\nThose consumers who didn\u2019t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don\u2019t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database. \n\nObjectives - \nThe following are the key objectives of the scheme - \na) Remove incentive for diversion. \nb) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer. \nc) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users \nd) Weed out fake/duplicate connections \ne) Allow Self Selection in subsidy ",
